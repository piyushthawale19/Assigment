Here is the complete README.md template. You can copy and paste this directly, then fill in the bracketed placeholders ([ ]) with your specific project details, links, and chosen name.üîê Project Name: [RoleVault / Dashkey / Your Chosen Name]Role-Based Authentication Full-Stack Mini ProjectThis project implements a secure, role-based authentication system demonstrating proficiency in modern full-stack development. The core objective is to manage user access via distinct User and Admin roles1. This assignment evaluates your ability to integrate the frontend and backend, solve problems, and successfully deploy the application2.üöÄ Deployed Application Links (Deliverables)The mandatory deliverables include publicly reachable URLs for both components3.ComponentDeployment PlatformStatusURLFrontend (Next.js)[Vercel / Netlify]Deployed[Your Deployed Frontend URL]Backend (Node/Express)[Render / Railway / Vercel Serverless]Deployed[Your Deployed Backend URL (Base API)]GitHub RepositoryGitHubLive[Your GitHub Repository Link]‚öôÔ∏è Technical StackThis project was built using the following required and suggested technologies4:CategoryTechnologyDetailsFrontendNext.js (TypeScript)Required framework for the client application[cite: 39].UI/StylingTailwind CSS & Shad CN/UIUsed for clean, effective styling and component implementation[cite: 40].BackendNode.js with ExpressRequired backend framework[cite: 27].Database[PostgreSQL/MongoDB]Used with [Prisma ORM / Mongoose] (free tier required)[cite: 28].AuthenticationJWT (or Session-Based)Used for securing the application state[cite: 14].SecurityBcryptUsed for secure password hashing[cite: 13, 29].üîë Core Features and RequirementsThe application meets all mandatory core requirements5:Role Selection on Signup: The signup page includes a mandatory dropdown for selecting the role (User or Admin)6666.Protected Dashboard: The dashboard route is protected and only accessible when a user is logged in7777.Personalized Header: Upon login, the user is redirected to the dashboard, which displays a welcome message showing the user's name and role8.Backend Endpoints: The minimum required API endpoints have been implemented9:POST /auth/signupPOST /auth/loginGET /auth/me (returns current user information for dashboard context) 10Implemented Optional Enhancements(Remove this section if you did not implement any optional features, or list the ones you did implement from the assignment's suggestions 11)[e.g., Logout Functionality12: Added a clear button for users to terminate their session.][e.g., Form Validation13: Used Zod/Joi for robust validation on signup and login forms.]üõ†Ô∏è Local Development SetupFollow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.1. PrerequisitesNode.js (v18+)npm or yarnA running instance of your chosen database ([PostgreSQL/MongoDB]).2. Backend Setup (Node/Express)Navigate to the backend directory: cd backendInstall dependencies: npm install (or yarn)Configure Environment: Create a file named .env and populate it using the provided .env.example file14.Code snippet# Example .env content
DATABASE_URL="[Your DB Connection String]"
JWT_SECRET="[A long, random string]"
PORT=9002
Database Migration (If using Prisma/PostgreSQL):Bashnpx prisma migrate dev --name init
Start the server: npm run devThe server will run at http://localhost:5000. Frontend Setup (Next.js)Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontendInstall dependencies: npm install (or yarn)Configure Environment: Create a file named .env.local and set your API URL:Code snippet# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:5000/api/v1"
Start the development server: npm run devThe client will run at http://localhost:9002
Access the ApplicationOpen your browser and navigate to http://localhost:9002 to access the frontend application.üìù Additional NotesEnsure that your database is running and accessible before starting the backend server. Adjust CORS settings in the backend if necessary to allow requests from your frontend domain. For any issues or questions, refer to the project's GitHub repository or contact [Your Contact Information].Happy coding!
